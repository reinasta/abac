# Ross on utilitarianism on promise keeping and lying (Carson)

## Ross's middle ground between utilitarianism and absolutism

Ross defines prima facie (conditional) duty or obligation as follows. 

(@pmd) **Conditional duty**: acts have features in virtue of which they satisfy different, and possibly opposing, moral values, 


For instance, breaking a promise tends to be wrong but tends to be good as an instance of relieving distress. 
The injunction against breaking a promise is a prima facie duty, and a *duty proper* is just the resultant duty when all features of an act are considered. 
Another example is of prima facie duty is that of not lying. Lying is morally wrong only if the act of lying does not conflict with the fulfilment of more important conditional duties.

When an act gives rise to conflicting prima facie duties, the importance of these duties determines the duty proper. 
And the duty proper reflects what is morally right and thus we ought to do. 
Weighing conditional duties against one another is a matter of moral perception; such deliberation involves moral risk and is uncertain (Aristotle, Ross, p. 144). 

- Ross's examples of prima facie duties: keep promises, don't lie, make reparations for harm, gratitude, distribute happiness according to merit, do things that benefit others, improve one's own intellect and moral character, don't harm. (pp. 143-4)
    + `don't harm` $\succ$ `help others`
    + the duties of perfect obligation (promise keeping, gratitude, and reparations) are very stringent
    + duties of fidelity (don't lie, don't break promises) are stringent, but can be defeated to avoid a big harm or to produce a great good; Ross in fact claims that all lies are cases of promise-breaking; 

Ross likens the knowledge of the basic moral principles with the knowledge of  axioms of arithmetic or geometry. 
He claims that his theory is better than utilitarianism since it agrees better with the common knowledge of basic moral principles. (p. 141) 
So common knowledge, by which he means "the moral convictions of thoughtful and well-educated people", are the data against which ethical claims are tested. These intuitions are the equivalent of perceptual data for the sciences, which, Ross thinks, makes moral theory similar to scientific theory (p. 147-8). 

- The problem with this view, Carson claims, is that ethicists are often in disagreement over moral claims. Ross sees the problem and suggests that disagreements should be eliminated. The idea might be to see these cases as akin to under-determination of the theory by the data.

## Act-utilitarianism

(@u) **Act-utilitarianism (U)**: an act can be justified if it results in the best consequences. 

(U) is equivalent to Ross's theory if we remove the first five duties from the latter, since utilitarians deny that there are obligations to keep promises, refrain from lying etc. that are independent of the consequences of the acts in questions. 
For utilitarians, but not so for Ross, there is no obligation of keeping one's promise or refrain from lying in abstraction of these acts' consequences. 
But, says Ross, when lying and not lying produce equally good consequences or when the latter produces just slightly better consequences than the former, this does not imply that lying is morally permissible. And this is obvious, and thus agrees with our knowledge of basic moral principles (p. 145). 

- Carson's example (p. 146): lying to a total stranger about a very insignificant matter, e.g. about my age to a stranger on a train or airplane. Since the stranger is bound to forget what I said, and I'm not going to see her again, my lying will not undermine trust between us. No harm is done. 
    + But utilitarians may say that the lie harms my character by making me more prone to lies and dishonesty, and this is bad because in general lying has worse consequences than telling the truth. 
    + Suppose that, in a certain context, the amount of harm that lying produces to one's character is equal to the amount of good that is a consequence of lying. E.g. I'm lying that I liked to house that you designed in order to spare your feelings (and saving us from some mild embarrassment), and there are no more consequences of my lying. Assuming that sparing my friend's feeling and spoiling my character cancel each other out, Ross would claim that it is clearly wrong to lie. However, that this is so is not at all clear.
