In the middle of all this, after all that, I was horrified. Sort
of. The merchandise has been returned in the depot of Berlin. In
the depot in Munich there were people who were being punished.
That was not acceptable. It was egregious. I was horrified. I
was flabbergasted. 

# Introduction

Not a few of mankind's original thinkers have been colourful
figures, led flamboyant lives and thus provided valuable material
for many a biography filled with a salacious story or two. Take
Friedrich Schiller, the German dramatic rebel and accidental
academic. When giving his inaugural lecture at the University of
Jena in 1789, he saw that far more people had turned up than could
be accommodated in the lecture hall. Rather than let his employers
find something bigger nearby, the youthful Schiller seized the
moment and marched with the crowd through the streets of Jena
to the town hall. There he lectured to an enthusiastic crowd of
thousands shouting ‘freedom’, subsequently enjoying the attention
he received from the liberated ladies of the town. Other fighters for
freedom and reason, such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Bertrand Russell,
led eccentric lives that had the local establishments in uproar. Even
a working-class hero like George Orwell could never quite divorce
himself from his upper-class public school upbringing, or so his
biographers tell us. All such activists – known and unknown –
fought their battles to improve the lot of ordinary men and women,
and quite a few advanced science and the arts along the way.

Noam Chomsky is one of the most notable contemporary champions 
of the people. He is also a scientist of the highest calibre. But
is he great material for a biography? Certainly not, if you ask the
subject. An intensely private man, he is horrified to be considered 
the main character in any story. He jokes about the notion
that people come to see him, listen to him, even adore him, when
in fact he is the most boring speaker ever to hit the stage. He gets
serious very quickly and tells his audiences that they have come
to hear about the ‘issues’ of our time, issues that are important to
them and, as it happens, to him. What is it that he knows and the
people don’t? Wrong question, he would say. The people merely
want to know the truth and they know it is hidden from them by a
vast propaganda machine. His skill is to lift the veil and reveal the
truth. Anyone can do it, says Chomsky, it only takes some dedicated
research and logical reasoning.

## Continuation

Stop there, Chomsky would say, don’t mix science with political
activism. There is no necessary connection between the two, especially
not in his case. Like Einstein’s theory of relativity, or Russell’s
principles of mathematical logic, Chomskyan linguistics takes years
of training and dedication to the scientific method to advance new
theories and make new discoveries. Political activism on the other
hand is the people’s domain, and while scientists are people, too,
there is no logical rule that says that a good scientist is also a good
political activist – and quite obviously less so the other way round
– however much we would like to believe in its possibility.

### Blah blah blah.

So let’s look at Noam Chomsky as two people: the scientist
(the linguist) and the political activist. His private life is remark-
able for its lack of an extraordinary story line. Given the status he
has achieved – quite unintended, as we shall see – and the income
and financial security that come with it, Chomsky is the first to
point out that he leads a privileged life, at least in comparison to
the working classes in America, and more so when set against the
abject poverty of the masses of people living in the so-called
Third World. What is important about Chomsky, however, is tha
he is one of those who says what the reasons are for this world of
oppression and blatant social injustice. In return he is vilified by
the corporate world of power, including the mainstream press, in
both the us and Europe – the German news magazine Der Spiegel
has described Chomsky as ‘Ayatollah des antiamerikanischen
Hasses’ (‘the Ayatollah of anti-American hatred’). 

# Conclusion

In 2005 Chomsky celebrated his 77th birthday. He is edging
closer to becoming an octogenarian linguist and political activist,
and bound to remember the public birthday wishes he received
from his wife Carol when he turned 70: ‘Well, seventy is nice, but
what I’m really looking forward to is eighty!’ 3 On his birthday, as
on every other day of the year, he receives some 200 e-mails deal-
ing with linguistics, politics and other matters. He answers them
all, every day of the week (though, befitting his many responsibili-
ties, a couple of personal assistants help him in the process). In
addition he prepares speeches, lecture notes, learned articles, his
latest book and other writing tasks. As a retired Emeritus Institute
Professor of Linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology (mit) he still contributes to teaching and research well
beyond the call of duty. Chomsky is a ferocious reader and reads
with great attention to detail. Over the years he has acquired an
encyclopaedic knowledge. As such he never stops working. His
output and achievements are enormous, yet he would say that a
humble factory worker on the assembly line produces far more
than he has ever done. He is deeply aware that his status within
the working classes is a privileged one. Still, the true nature of an
academic worker is embodied in Chomsky.
